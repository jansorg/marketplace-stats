# Generating Reports
Reports are self-contained HTML files. The file uses an optional font from Google Fonts, but everything else is in the HTML file.

To generate a report, you need the following:
- **The numeric ID of your plugin**<br>This is the number in the marketplace URL. For example, the ID of BashSupport Pro is 13841, because the URL is https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13841-bashsupport-pro.
- **An API token**<br>You can generate a token at https://plugins.jetbrains.com/author/me/tokens. `marketplace-stats` can read the token from the command line or from a file.

The following command generates `report.html` for plugin 123456. The token is retrieved from the given file.
 
```bash
# marketplace-stats is in $GOPATH/bin, e.g. $HOME/go/bin
marketplace-stats -plugin-id 123456 -token-file token.txt -out report.html 
```

## Tips & Tricks
- There's a tooltip on the numbers of the `Customers` column in the table of monthly summaries. The tooltip tells more about the changes in active customers in a month.  

# Go Client for the JetBrains Marketplace

# Contributing
This tool is made for my own plugins and requirements. I'm not planning to spend time to adjust it to the requirements of others. 

I'll gladly accept pull requests, if they don't break existing functionality.
